# Contributing

When contributing to this project, if there is not already an existing issue, then please create one to open discussions around 
the changes. If there is already a triaged issue ready for work, please express your desire to work on this issue in a comment 
to avoid multiple parties working on the same item.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. All new functionality must also include passing unit tests and/or integration tests demonstrating the correctness
   of the contributed code. Modifications to existing functionality do not need additional tests unless a new use case
   that is not tested by current coverage. All testing philosophies are welcome so long as they conform to the general 
   structure and style guidelines in the project.
2. To minimize merging issues, please ensure that you pull the latest code from upstream prior to committing and creating
   your pull request.
3. Core maintainers may ask you to make additional edits during a code review, this is always intended to both be helpful
   and beneficial to the overall quality of the project. Nobody is correct 100% the time and counter-arguments / defences
   are always welcome so long as presented in constructive manner. 
4. Pull requests will be accepted in as timely a fashion as possible. Core contributors will make an effort to provide feedback
   in situations where there is delay to avoid the feeling of a PR being left out and forgotten about. 
5 If your pull request is denied, don't give up. A pull request will never be denied without constructive feedback and
   attempting to make another pull re quest is always encouraged.
